## General Info
A TicTacToe simulation game created using C# but with a twist. This piece describes a simple strategy-based approach without using recursive algorithms or a complex database of stored moves. It should be stated, at this stage, that ‘using AI’ refers to the sample application’s ability to mimic the actions and responses of a human player, in contrast to apps that simply allow two people to play against each other. It’s not an exercise in machine learning. It’s more of an example of how to use the chain of responsibility pattern to implement a structured response to moves made by a human opponent.
## Technologies Used
- Csharp
  

## Setup
Using the debugger you can see this project. Traditionally the first player plays with "X". And the AI automatically gets the other symbol.
Only one player can play at a time.
If any of the players have filled a square then the other player and the same player cannot override that square.
There are only two conditions that may be match will be draw or may be win.
The player that succeeds in placing three respective mark (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game.
This creates a perfect opponent though: The computer will never ever lose. How to make him more human is then fine-tuning (e.g., randomly discard the choice and place the mark in a random cell)
